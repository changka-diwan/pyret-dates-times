 The DayOfWeek represents the possible days of the standard business week.

  The e-nums 1 through 7 happen to coincide with the trade convention
  for weeks in the Gragorian Calendar, where 1 represents Monday, 2 represents
  Tuesday, and so on.
  
  These seven variables for DayOfWeek may be
  created and manipulated with the methods and functions below.

 @section{DayOfWeek Methods}

 @dow-method["get-display-name"
           #:contract (a-arrow DoW S)
           #:args (list (list "self" #f))
           #:return S
           ]

 Gets the textual representation following the trade representation
 of the week such as 'Monday' or 'Friday'.

 @examples{
  check:
    d5.get-display-name() is "Friday"
  end
 }

  @dow-method["get-value"
           #:contract (a-arrow DoW N)
           #:args (list (list "self" #f))
           #:return N
           ]

Gets the day-of-week Number value following the
 trade week representation.

 @examples{
  check:
    d3.get-value() is 3
  end
 }

  @dow-method["change"
           #:contract (a-arrow DoW (a-arrow N N) S)
           #:args (list (list "self" #f) (list "f" #f))
           #:return S
           ]

Returns the DayOfWeek after modifying the given DayOfWeek through 'f'.

 @examples{
  check:
    d6.change(lam(x): x * -3 end) is d3
  end
 }

 @dow-method["minus"
           #:contract (a-arrow DoW N S)
           #:args (list (list "self" #f) (list "days" #f))
           #:return S
           ]

Returns the DayOfWeek that is the specified number of days before this one.

 @examples{
  check:
    d1.minus(10) is d5
  end
 }

 @dow-method["plus"
           #:contract (a-arrow DoW N S)
           #:args (list (list "self" #f) (list "days" #f))
           #:return S
           ]

Returns the DayOfWeek that is the specified number of days after this one.

 @examples{
  check:
    d1.plus(10) is d4
  end
 }

 @section{Duration Functions}

 These functions require the DayOfWeek module to be
 @pyret{import}ed, as indicated in the examples.

 @function["day-of-num"
           #:contract (a-arrow N DoW)
           #:args '(("n" #f))
           #:return DoW
           ]{

  Obtains an instance of DayOfWeek from a Number value.

  @examples{
   check:
     day-of-num(3) is d3
     day-of-num(-12) is d2
     day-of-num(22/7)
       raises "Can only create DayOfWeek from Natural Numbers" 
   end
  }
 }

 @function["day-of-text"
           #:contract (a-arrow S DoW)
           #:args '(("n" #f))
           #:return DoW
           ]{

  Returns the DayOfWeek from the specified name
  in trade week respresentation.

  @examples{
   check:
     day-of-text("THUrsDaY") is d4
     day-of-text("mon")
       raises "Please enter the day in full trade form eg 'Monday'"
   end
  }
 }
            
}
